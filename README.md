## 📊 Results & Insights  

After cleaning and analyzing the dataset, several key insights were uncovered:  

### 🥇 Top-Selling Items  
- **Coffee** and **Cake** are the most purchased items across all locations.  
- Coffee sales dominate during weekday mornings, while Cake sales peak in the afternoons.  

### 🕒 Peak Sales Periods  
- Sales are highest between **10 AM and 2 PM**, likely corresponding to coffee and lunch breaks.  
- Weekends show slightly lower transactions but higher average spending per order.  

### 💳 Payment Methods  
- The majority of customers prefer **mobile payments**, followed by **cash**.  
- Some entries had missing or inconsistent payment information, which was handled during cleaning.  

### 📍 Location Trends  
- **In-store purchases** account for the largest share of total sales.  
- **Takeaway** orders tend to have smaller quantities but are more frequent.  

### 💰 Revenue Insights  
- Average customer spend per transaction: **KES X.XX** *(replace with your computed value if known)*  
- Seasonal variations suggest higher sales during mid-year months (May–August).
- Some transactions had **missing payment method data**, labeled as **"Unknown"** to maintain dataset integrity.

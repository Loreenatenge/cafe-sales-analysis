# Caf√© Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes caf√© sales data using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn/Matplotlib. 
The goal is to explore sales trends, understand customer behavior, and visualize key metrics from a messy dataset.

## Features

- Converted numeric and date columns
- Handled missing values
- Explored data using visualizations:
  - Total sales per item
  - Quantity sold per item
  - Sales by payment method
  - Sales by location
  - Sales trends over time

## How to Run
1. Activate the virtual environment:
2. Install required packages:
3. Run the analysis:


Plots will be saved automatically in the project folder.

## Next Steps / Improvements
- Build interactive dashboards using Plotly 
- Add predictive analysis to forecast sales
- Explore correlations between items, prices, and locations
- Implement more advanced data cleaning techniques to handle missing or inconsistent data
